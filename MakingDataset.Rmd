Load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
```

The file I want to load is a fixed width file where the widths are specified by a 95 page PDF table. Using the PDF_Peeler.Rmd file we parsed the PDF table into a useable csv file.

From:
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/Vitalstatsonline.htm

Get column information.

>Note that before loading the codebook_decoder, I added a column called Want to the codebook_decoder to mark which columns are of interest

```{r}
columns <- read_csv("codebook_decoder.csv")
column_lengths <- columns %>% pull(Length)
column_names <- columns %>% pull(Variable)
```

Read in full dataset using column widths

```{r}
col_widths <- fwf_widths(column_lengths, column_names)
full_data <- read_fwf("Nat2018.txt", col_positions = col_widths)
```

Sample 20000 rows

```{r}
set.seed(6274353) # marieke in phone digits
nat <- sample_n(full_data, 20000)
# rm(full_data)
```

Subset for columns of interest

```{r}
keep_cols <- columns %>%
  filter(Want == "X") %>%
  pull(name)

nat <- nat %>%
  select(one_of(keep_cols))
```

Resulting Dataset has dimensions: `r dim(nat)`

How many c-sects in subset?

```{r}
nat %>%
  count(DMETH_REC)
```

Recode missings as NA
```{r}
nat <- nat %>%
  mutate(DOB_TT = na_if(DOB_TT, 9999),
         DMAR = na_if(DMAR, 9),
         MEDUC = na_if(MEDUC, 9), 
         FAGECOMB = na_if(FAGECOMB, 99),
         FRACE6 = na_if(FRACE6, 9),
         FEDUC = na_if(FEDUC, 9),
         PRIORLIVE = na_if(PRIORLIVE, 99),
         PRIORTERM = na_if(PRIORTERM, 99),
         TBO_REC = na_if(TBO_REC, 9),
         PREVIS = na_if(PREVIS, 99),
         M_Ht_In = na_if(M_Ht_In, 99),
         BMI = na_if(BMI, 99.9),
         DWgt_R = na_if(DWgt_R, 999),
         WTGAIN = na_if(WTGAIN, 99),
         RF_CESARN = na_if(RF_CESARN, 99),
         NO_RISKS = na_if(NO_RISKS, 9),
         ME_PRES = na_if(ME_PRES, 9),
         ME_ROUT = na_if(ME_ROUT, 9),
         RDMETH_REC = na_if(RDMETH_REC, 9),
         DMETH_REC = na_if(DMETH_REC, 9),
         ATTEND = na_if(ATTEND, 9),
         APGAR5 = na_if(APGAR5, 99),
         COMBGEST = na_if(COMBGEST, 99),
         DBWT = na_if(DBWT, 9999))
```

Drop a few more variables

```{r}
nat <- nat %>%
  select(-MAR_P, -RF_CESAR, -RDMETH_REC)
```

Use forcats to recode variables
fct_recode(x, new = "old", new = "old")

Check on progress
```{r}
glimpse(nat)
```

The following variables need to be mutated as.numeric
DOB_MM 
DOB_TT
PRIORLIVE
PRIORTERM
PREVIS
WTGAIN
RF_CESARN
APGAR5
DBWT

```{r}
nat <- nat %>%
  mutate(DOB_MM = as.numeric(DOB_MM),
         DOB_TT = as.numeric(DOB_TT),
         PRIORLIVE = as.numeric(PRIORLIVE),
         PRIORTERM = as.numeric(PRIORTERM),
         PREVIS = as.numeric(PREVIS),
         WTGAIN = as.numeric(WTGAIN),
         RF_CESARN = as.numeric(RF_CESARN),
         APGAR5 = as.numeric(APGAR5),
         DBWT = as.numeric(DBWT))
```

We will still need to deal with Y/N questions to set them as 1/0 but I'll have the students do that.

Write out clean datafile
```{r}
write_csv(nat, "Nativity2018_clean.csv")
```
